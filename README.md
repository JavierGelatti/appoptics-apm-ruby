# Ruby extensions for the Tracelytics

## The oboe_fu plugin

In addition to language-level instrumentation, Tracelytics is also aware of Rails, capturing controllers and actions for requests, as well as ActiveRecord queries. Support comes from a plugin called oboe\_fu. From your rails directory go into the `vendor/plugins` directory and run the following command:

    $ git clone git@github.com:tracelytics/oboe_fu.git

## The oboe extension

A Ruby extension that wraps the Tracelytics Oboe instrumentation library (liboboe) can be found in the `oboe_ext` directory.  The OO interface this extension provides to Ruby programs is generated by SWIG from the C++ wrapper in `oboe_ext/oboe.hpp`.  Build instructions can be found in `oboe_ext/README`.
