In addition to language-level instrumentation, Tracelytics is also aware of Rails, capturing controllers and actions for requests, as well as ActiveRecord queries. Support comes from a plugin called oboe\_fu. From your rails directory go into the `vendor/plugins` directory and run the following command:

    $ git clone git@github.com:tracelytics/oboe_fu.git
